# Employee-Attrition-EDA

# Introduction

Employee attrition, the phenomenon of employees leaving a company, is a significant concern for organizations. It impacts productivity, morale, and overall business performance.

In the modern business landscape, retaining talented employees is paramount for sustained success. High attrition rates can disrupt workflow, increase recruitment costs, and lead to a loss of valuable institutional knowledge. Consequently, organizations strive to identify the underlying reasons for employee turnover and develop strategies to mitigate it.

This project delves into the world of HR data analytics, where we explore a comprehensive dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and potential drivers of employee attrition. By analyzing variables such as age, gender, salary, and other relevant factors, we aim to provide actionable insights that can inform HR policies, improve employee retention, and ultimately contribute to the organization's long-term success.
